<p> Defenders are the second line of defence. In the line of defence there are/is a CB/s, which are 
defenders which play in the centre of the defence. RB, which are 
defenders which play in the right side of defence. LB, which are 
defenders which play in the left side of defence.
Not all defenders are neciserelly good defensivly, some of whom are the to offer extra support in attack.

<img class="dimg" src="Images/Def.png" alt="Defenders formation">
<p> There's a forgotten role in todays game the "Sweeper". A Sweeper is a Centre-Back playing behind the defence and clearing untargetted deliveries.<br> Sometimes the Sweeper supported the attack.<br>
From an Austrian walking on the beach and witnessing a fishing net catching fish. And an Italian who broke that formation using an English tactic as old as the queen.

</tr>
<tr>
<td>1930s</td>
<td> The first to play with a "Sweeper formation" was Karl Rappan in Switzerland.<br>
In his teams, the Sweeper was a "Verrou". The "Verrou" lined up behind the defence and only cleared deliveries.<br>
He was big and good in the air. Because his job was only to clear balls he wasn't a technical and didn't have the organizing tactical skill reqired from future Sweepers.</td>
<td><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Severino_Minelli" target="_blank" title="Severino Minelli-Wikipedia">Severino Minelli</a><br>
The "Verrou" in Switzerland's NT tactic and Grasshopper's tactic both under Karl Rappan.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1940s</td>
<td> World War 2 stopped the evolution of football. Profetional football wasn't played, team couldn't try new tactics and even World Cup and Olympic games didn't take place.</td>
<td> World War 2 realy inhibited football from developing. There wasn't realy a stand-out "Sweeper" back than.</tb>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1950s</td>
<td> The emergents of "the back 4" took place in the '50s. Brazil's 1958 World Cup winning team formaly brought "the back 4" to the world but it was actually Hungary's "Magical Magyars" who used it first although the played a much more fluid style of play.</td>
<td> There wasn't realy a sweeper in the '50s because of the temporary tactical shift to "the back 4".<br> The closest to a "Sweeper" was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gyula_L%C3%B3r%C3%A1nt" target="_blank" title="Gyula Lorant-Wikipedia"> Gyula Lorant</a> who drpped back to a sweeper role in both "Magical Magyars" and Honved.</td> 
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1960s</td>
<td> Helenio Herrera is the manager most associated with "Catenaccio". He took "The Bolt-Verrou" tactic, developed by Karl Rappan, and transformed it (also based on Nereo Rocco's Triestina and Padova tactics) into a continental conquering tactic.
Differnet from the "Verrou", he played in the sweeper role a "Libero" a more technical player who was usually renowned for positional awareness. The Libero's main job was still to clear deliveries but just as important he needed to organize the team from the back.</td>
<td><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armando_Picchi" target="_blank" title="Armando Picchi-Wikipedia">Armando Picchi</a><br> The "Sweeper/Libero" of the great "Grande Inter" coached by Heleniuo Herrera.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1970s</td>
<td> In this decade the sweeper realy thrived. Rinus Michels's very fluid "Total Football" included a very attacking "Libero" which has never been tried before. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arie_Haan" target="_blank" title="Arie Haan-Wikipedia">Arie Haan</a>, a converted midfielder, fitted perfectly into this new attacking use of the "Libero".
Michels designed this tactic in order to suprise opponents with ball rotation and espesially to use all outfield players in all position to create unpredictability.</td>
<td><a href="CB.html#beckenbauers" title="Franz Beckenbauer-Soccer's HOF">Franz Beckenbauer</a>, a converted midfielder, used his stamina to preform to perfection the attacking "Libero" role, defending, attacking and organizing from deep. He shaped future thinking of managers that sweepers ought to be the most emphasized and important position.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1980s</td>
<td> With help from Beckenbauer, the "Sweeper/Libero" became the most impartant role on the field. Rather offensive or defensive the "Libero" was in the peak of powers most of the world used it. Nevertheless English teams started fading from using this role using a flat "back 4" and winning 4 Champions League in that decade (Nottingham Forest, Liverpool & Aston Villa).</td>
<td><a href="CB.html#Scireas" title="Gaetano Scirea-Soccer's HOF">Gaetano Scirea</a>, the "Libero" of Juventus, Atalanta and Italian NT. A very offensive "Libero who used his attacking intelligence going forward.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1990s</td>
<td> Arrigo Sacchi and his 4-4-2, offside trap, pressing system killed the sweeper role. Yet his captain Baresi played sometimes as an attacking Centre-Back, his role can't be classified as a classic "Libero" since he played in a flat back 4 using offside trap. Baresi rarely dropped back and cleared deliveries, a trait "Sweepers", "Liberos" and "Verrous" were renowned for.</td>
<td><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthias_Sammer" target="_blank" title="Matthias Sammer-Wikipedia">Matthias Sammer</a> is arguably the last great "Sweeper/Libero". An aggressive "Libero" who was very good going forward he was Dortmunds best player in 1997 Chmapions League triumph.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2000s -<br>2010s</td>
<td> The emergents of the Premier League and Ferguson, Mourinho and Guardiola shifting to "the back 4" using 4-4-2, 4-3-3 and 4-2-3-1 formations left the "Sweeper" fans wander, rather we'll anytime ever.</td>
<td><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonardo_Bonucci" target="_blank" title="Leonardo Bonucci-Wikipedia">Leonardo Bonucci</a> is arguably the best and only capable Centre-Back who can play as a "Sweeper", taday. In 2015, Juventus reached the Champions League final with Bonucci playing as a "Sweeper/Libero" and being the Centre-Back in the world.</td>
